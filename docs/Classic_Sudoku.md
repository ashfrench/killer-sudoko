> Classic sudoku has been around for years and can easily be solved through brute force. The aim of this project is to show and demonstrate how to solve example puzzles. Show techniques and provide solutions.
>
> A simple brute force algorithm will be provided to show how to solve a [well-posed puzzle][1]
>
> Further algorithms will be provided with a [human style UX][2] to help the user learn how to solve the puzzles

## Rules of Sudoku

> In [classic Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku), the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each [column](./Terminology.md#column), each [row](./Terminology.md#row), and each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids that compose the grid ([nonet](./Terminology.md#nonet)) contains all the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a [well-posed puzzle][1] has a single solution.

### Examples of Sudoku Grids

The below sample grids are taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku

<table>

  <colgroup>
    <col span="1" style="width: 50%;">
  </colgroup>

<thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Example Sudoku Grid</th>
      <th>Example Hard Sudoku Grid</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

## [Mathematics of Sudoku][3]


> Mathematics can be used to study Sudoku puzzles to answer questions such as "How many filled Sudoku grids are there?", "What is the minimal number of clues in a valid puzzle?" and "In what ways can Sudoku grids be symmetric?" through the use of [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics) and [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory).
> 
> The analysis of Sudoku is generally divided between analyzing the properties of unsolved puzzles (such as the minimum possible number of given clues) and analyzing the properties of solved puzzles. Initial analysis was largely focused on enumerating solutions, with results first appearing in 2004
>
> For classical Sudoku, the number of filled grids is: ```6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 (6.671×10^21), ```
> which reduces to 5,472,730,538 essentially different solutions under the validity preserving transformations. There are 26 possible types of symmetry, but they can only be found in about 0.005% of all filled grids. An ordinary puzzle with a unique solution must have at least 17 clues. There is a solvable puzzle with at most 21 clues for every solved grid. The largest minimal puzzle found so far has 40 clues in the 81 cells.



### Puzzles

#### Minimum number of givens
> Ordinary Sudokus (proper puzzles) have a unique solution. A minimal Sudoku is a Sudoku from which no clue can be removed leaving it a proper Sudoku. Different minimal Sudokus can have a different number of clues. This section discusses the minimum number of givens for proper puzzles.

#### Ordinary Sudoku
> Many Sudokus have been found with [17 clues][5], [although finding them is not a trivial task.][6] A 2014 paper by Gary McGuire, Bastian Tugemann, and Gilles Civario proved that the minimum number of clues in any proper Sudoku is 17 through an exhaustive computer search based on [hitting set enumeration][7]. The ELI5 is that 16 clues is not enough to uniquely determine a solution, and 17 clues is enough.

#### Symmetrical Sudoku
> The fewest clues in a Sudoku with two-way diagonal symmetry (a 180° rotational symmetry) is believed to be 18, and in at least one case such a Sudoku also exhibits [automorphism][8]. A Sudoku with 24 clues, [dihedral symmetry][9] (a 90° rotational symmetry, which also includes a symmetry on both orthogonal axis, 180° rotational symmetry, and diagonal symmetry) is known to exist, but it is not known if this number of clues is minimal for this class of Sudoku.

### Total number of minimal Puzzles
> The number of minimal Sudokus (Sudokus in which no clue can be deleted without losing uniqueness of the solution) is not precisely known. However, statistical techniques combined with a generator [('Unbiased Statistics of a CSP – A Controlled-Bias Generator')][10], show that there are approximately (with 0.065% relative error):
>
> * ```3.18 × 10^17``` distinct minimal puzzles,
> * ```2.55 × 10^25``` minimal puzzles that are not pseudo-equivalent (i.e. same arrangement where all instances of one digit is switched with another digit).
