> This is a rewrite in kotlin of my Computer Science dissertation project. I Studied `Computer Science with a Year in Industry (2006-2010)` with [IBM][1] `(2008-2009)` at [Manchester University][2]. I achieved a 1st class honours for this project and was in the top 10 of the year.
>
> The goals of this project is to be able to take any Killer Sudoku Grid and then be able to solve them from said grid.
>
> I should be able to demonstrate solving by [brute force][3], but also be able to solve using [human techniques][4].
>
> The human provided techniques should also be able to graphically display or verbally describe how to solve said Sudoku Grid
> 
> I will be using https://sudoku.com/ as a source of data to test my algorithms
